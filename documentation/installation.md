# INSTALLATION

There's not an installation. You just load the __cc_script.sh__ file. 2 way to do that:

# 1- Using git

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/yusufdaglioglu/cc_scripts"
cd "cc_scripts"
cd "release"
source "cc_scripts.sh"
```

# 2- Using curl
If you don't have "git" command, you only need a single file:

```sh
FILE_PATH="$HOME/cc_scripts.sh" # or anywhere you want

curl --output "$FILE_PATH" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yusufdaglioglu/cc_scripts/master/release/cc_scripts.sh"

source "$FILE_PATH"
```

ready! Now type on terminal __"c"__ and press __TAB__, terminal will show you all available functions.
